# SMD Database Setup

The `factory_log` table and the `smd_database` database are created by this SQL script. When importing raw data into the database, it is stored in the table.

## Important Notes

- The `factory_log` and `smd_database` tables that this script generates are used for data structure.
- **The real database is on your XAMPP server.** This is not the real database.


Use XAMPP to import the SQL file into the appropriate environment so that you may connect to the actual database.
