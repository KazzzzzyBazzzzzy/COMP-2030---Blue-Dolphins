# SMD Database Setup

This SQL script creates a database called `smd_database` and a table called `factory_log`. The table is used to store raw data when imported into the database.

## Important Notes

- The `smd_database` and `factory_log` table created by this script are for data structuring purposes.
- **This is not the actual database.** The actual database exists on your XAMPP server.

Make sure you import the SQL file into the correct environment using XAMPP to connect to the real database.
